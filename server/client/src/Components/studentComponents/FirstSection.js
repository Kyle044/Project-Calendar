          As a state college, Eulogio “Amang” Rodriguez Institute of Science and
          Technology (EARIST) believes that education is not an area of
          knowledge that can be arrogated unto itself by one profession, nor it
          is a division separate and distinct from the society and the times in
          which it flourishes. It is a plexus of knowledge and skills applied to
          the economic, social and moral development of self-actualized and
          productive citizenry.
